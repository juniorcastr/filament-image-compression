## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.1 or higher
- Composer
- Laravel 10+ application for testing
- Filament 4+ installed

### Installation

1. Fork and clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/filament-image-compression.git
cd filament-image-compression
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
composer install
```

3. Set up a test Laravel application or use an existing one:
```bash
# In your Laravel app
composer require --dev juniorcastr/filament-image-compression:@dev
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
composer test

# Run tests with coverage
composer test-coverage

# Run specific test file
./vendor/bin/pest tests/Unit/ImageCompressionServiceTest.php
```

### Code Quality

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Run PHPStan analysis
composer analyse

# Fix code style
composer format

# Run all quality checks
composer quality
```

## Coding Standards

### PHP Standards

- Follow **PSR-12** coding standard
- Use **strict types** declaration in all PHP files
- Add **comprehensive docblocks** for all public methods
- Use **type hints** for all parameters and return types

### Code Style

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace CondoSmart\FilamentImageCompression;

/**
 * Example class following our standards
 */
class ExampleClass
{
    /**
     * Example method with proper documentation
     */
    public function exampleMethod(string $parameter): bool
    {
        // Implementation
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Classes**: PascalCase (`ImageCompressionService`)
- **Methods**: camelCase (`compressImage`)
- **Variables**: camelCase (`$maxWidth`)
- **Constants**: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_FILE_SIZE`)

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual classes and methods in isolation
- **Feature Tests**: Test complete workflows and integrations
- **Use Pest PHP** for all tests
- **Mock external dependencies** when appropriate

### Test Example

```php
<?php

use CondoSmart\FilamentImageCompression\Services\ImageCompressionService;

it('compresses images correctly', function () {
    $service = new ImageCompressionService();
    $file = UploadedFile::fake()->image('test.jpg', 2000, 1500);
    
    $result = $service->compressImage($file, 'public', 'test', 1920, 80);
    
    expect($result)->toBeString()
        ->and($result)->toEndWith('.webp');
});
```
